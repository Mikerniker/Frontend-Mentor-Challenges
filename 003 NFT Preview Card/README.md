### What I learned

- I had to review how to add an SVG as an  HTML <object> element and use width and height to specify the size of the SVG image.
  - Example: <object data="./images/icon-ethereum.svg" width="30" height="30"> </object>

- Learned How to add Image Overlay on Hover:
  - This was a useful resource that showed me how to do it: https://www.w3schools.com/HOWTO/howto_css_image_overlay_title.asp
  - I'm not fully confident in using it, also I'm not clear on how to center the svg eye.

- Reviewed the difference between rgb vs hsl
  
- How to make an image see through on hover
