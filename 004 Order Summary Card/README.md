## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Had to figure out how to get the svg to fit the container, I used: `{ width: 100%; height: auto; }` to fit the div.
- Adding a shadow to the button by using box-shadow.
- Reviewed how to remove anchor tag underline by using `{text-decoration: none; }`


### Continued development
- I'm not sure if I implemented the box-shadow correctly, as well as the colors for the hover states, since I don't have access to the design follow, these were just estimated.


### Useful resources

- [Resource to Scale SVG](https://css-tricks.com/scale-svg/) - This helped me adjust the size of the svg to fit the div. Adding it here for future reference.
- [Box-shadow](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_box-shadow.asp)
- [Remove Underline from Anchor Tag](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-remove-underline-for-anchors-tag-using-css/#:~:text=The%20underline%20can%20be%20easily,the%20underline%20from%20anchor%20tag.)
