## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Concepts I reviewed
- How to remove the border on a button by adding:
  - border: none;
  - used px for the border-radius to change the corners
- Adding a line through text by using:
  - text-decoration: line-through
- Reviewed the use of flex box to:
  - create a row
  - center items using flexbox, I mainly used: display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; 
- Letter-spacing: 3px
- I learned how to change the cursor to a hand pointer by using {cursor: pointer;}
- Focus states
- Media queries (something I still get confused about but am working on)

### Useful resources

- [Focus States resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus#:~:text=The%20%3Afocus%20CSS%20pseudo%2Dclass,with%20the%20keyboard's%20Tab%20key.) - This helped me understand what focus states are.
